# Unit 6 - webpack/babel, data structures, binary seach, sorts, figma, node
---
1. Udemy - Finish Andrew’s basic js class (Webpack, babel). Note that webpack and babel versions have been updated, so try to use a newer version to set this up! You may find this difficult as the original tutorial may not work at all, but rely on googling keywords to get through and ask questions on slack! The main skill you’re learning is how to upgrade an old library and handle breaking changes

2. Look for Udemy sales for (get most recent edition if multiple versions are available):
   The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)

3. Udemy - Continue Colt Algo and Data structure class to up end of section 14 (binary search, bubble, insertion, selection sorts)

4. Udemy - Start "JavaScript: The Advanced Concepts (2022 Update)" by Andrei Neagoie to end of section 5 (js engine, closures, prototypal inheritance). These topics will be familiar, but will be discussed a lot deeper. Useful for both review and further investigation

5. Udemy - Start Andrew’s Node class https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/ to end of section 5 (fs, error handling, handling requests)

6. Project - buttonCreator

7. Project - algo generator Continue html/css/js review by making a simple view that allows you to type in an input and clicking on a button renders the result of the algo. Use live server in VSCode, no need to make your own server. Figma and wire-framing intro. Use separate files for each algo!
