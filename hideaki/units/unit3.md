# Unit 3 - In depth html/css, understand how to choose the right looping tools

Note - when you get to `array.reduce()`, ask for practice problems in slack!

1. important terms:
   - `imperative` vs `declarative` (for loop vs Array.forEach)
   - `operating system`, `system programmer`
     - file system
     - command line interface
     - kernel

2. freeCodeCamp - finish all remaining tasks in Responsive Design (html and css)

3. freeCodeCamp - start JavaScript Alrogithms and Data Structures section up to end of “Basic Data Structures”(first few sections will be review, but that’s ok). For the Regex section, no need to memorize anything! Just do the exercise once and take notes and don’t get too caught up in it (be aware of what it does)

4. Do a few mock interviews with js algorithms. Make sure you are communicating, and make the mock interview flow a part of everyday studying.

5. If you haven’t already, purchase Udemy class `“Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and ..“` by Jonas Schmedtmann and go to end of Section 4

6. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohJcZW60br0 (post-css) tutorial to understand the difference between css, sass, and post-css

7. CSX - complete up to “Closure, Scope & Execution Context”, and attend related lectures

8. Udemy - Modern Javascript Bootcamp complete Section 9 “Expanding Our JS knowledge” (ternary, errors)

9. Make a statement using “ES (or EcmaScript)“, “browser”, “javascript engine”, “babel”, “transpiler”

10. Be able to add the `os` (or operating system) into the narrative for explaining how computers work

11. Be able to explain the difference between a `for loop`, `while loop`, `for in loop`, `for of loop`, `forEach` and the pros and cons of each. Your js should be `declarative` from this point forward.

12. Be able to articulate the inputs and outputs of the array methods `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce` (expect to spend a ton of time on reduce!)
