# Unit 8 - Hold Graph, Tries, Heaps but, focus on React
1. Udemy - rest of Colt can be saved for a 2nd job hunt. If you want to, you can go for it! Skipped topics - quick sort, radix sort, graph, tries, heaps, etc..
2. Udemy - Finish Andrei class (modules, error handling)
3. Udemy - Continue Andrewâ€™s React class to end of section 13 (redux)
4. Udemy - Finish Node class (mongoDb, jest, heroku)
5. Project: turn the algo generator into a full app (without live server) by moving the algorithm logic to the backend. Make an express server API that triggers the algo call. Use a fake db to write data into to cache answers for long recursive algos like fib. Add jest and do unit tests on the algos
6. How does the internet work from the browser to the back end?
## Requirements before unit interview
- can give overview of systems-design of your algo generator
- can explain concepts of caching in both front-end and back-end
