Assignment -3

Again, these are no longer meant to be done in a week as we’re not going at the crazy fast pace anymore. Do this after you’re done with assignment-2!

1. Finish FCC html and css sections, continue to JS section and aim to finish js basics and es6 over this and the next assignment period

2. finish csx up to recursion

3. Research the entire system of Browsers, JS Engine, html, css, JS

4. 
- The browser is needed to render html, css, and js. Browsers can’t read any other languages.
html, css, and js languages are being updated every year. 

- Even if the language gets an update, that needs to be implemented by the browser. This is the basic concept of support. For ex. CSS added flexbox in 2015 in css 3 as part of the language, but browsers then needed to update their code to support the new syntax. This means the css flexbox syntax worked in Chrome and Safari first, then Firefox, then others (Internet explorer still hasn’t adopted it yet, I think).

- check out caniuse.com for browser support in html, css, and js. You will use this a lot.

- How do you connect html, css, and js in an html file?

- What does the defer keyword do?

- What is the significance of putting the script tag at the END of the body (if not using defer)

- What does the JS engine do exactly? Be familiar with some names like V8, SpiderMonkey. Review the concept of interpretation vs compilation related to this

- What does it mean when a website is responsive?
