assignment-2

As usual, google anything that you don’t understand. Of course, if the question itself is badly worded and you don’t understand the assignment, I’ll be happy to clear that up!

1. Important terms (look up and take notes):

- CLI (command line interface) or command line tools vs GUI
- Git vs gitHub and version control
- Be familiar with names of other popular computer languages
- Dynamically typed languages vs statically typed languages
- Function vs Method
- Function Declaration vs Function Expression (specifically in js)
- Front-end vs back-end. Research this for about 30 minutes (no more than that) using multiple resources while writing any questions about this topic
- DOM, event listeners

2. In Github, make a new repo.
   Clone that repo to your local machine.
   Push a .txt file with the answers to the 2 questions below to your GitHub only using the git CLI (no GUIs)

3. Order the following from low to high level languages [c++, javascript, binary, assembly code]

4. Which of the following does not belong? C, Python, Go, Git, Java, Bash

5. Javascript is often referred to as a client-side language. Research this in detail until you can briefly explain how js (short for javascript) is compiled OR interpreted by the browser until it turns into binaries for computers to be able to read

6. Continue freeCodeCamp, Andrew Mead’s course (sections 7 and 8), CSX, and any other coding resources.

7. Share 1 or more “aha” moments you had in this channel. Ex. “I couldn’t get this function to run [show code snippet] and kept getting this error [show error] but after an hour I realized it was because I was using const instead of let and had nothing to do with what the error message was actually displaying
